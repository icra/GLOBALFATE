# GLOBAL-FATE Version 1.0.0

GLOBAL-FATE is a GIS-based model that simulates the fate of contaminants from human consumption discharged to the global river network. We provide here an outline of the utility of GLOBAL-FATE as an assessment tool for the fate of chemicals delivered from point sources to the fluvial system. The nature of the model allows using any microcontaminant that decreases at a rate proportional to its concentration in the aquatic media.

Highlights<br />
•	A GIS-based model for simulation of contaminant flow through the river network is presented<br />
•	It performs a global calculation and is as well suited for single (at small scale) basins <br />
•	It is adaptable to a wide range of solutes<br />
•	The model allows mapping the contaminant concentrations<br />
