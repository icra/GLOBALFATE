about=GLOBAL-FATE is a GIS-based model that simulates the fate of contaminants from human consumption discharged to the global river network. The nature of the model allows using any microcontaminant that decreases at a rate proportional to its concentration in the aquatic media. For any question, please contact cfont@icra.cat. Please refer our article: Font C., Bregoli F., Acuña V., Sabater S., Marcé R. GLOBAL-FATE: A GIS-based model for assessing contaminants fate in the global river network (submitted)
