Currently, the plugin is available for QGIS 3. To install it, first, you need to set the folder of the QGIS plugins. 
To do so, open QGIS and go to menu Settings -> User profiles -> Open active profile folder. From there, you can go to python -> plugins.
That's the plugin folder for QGIS v3.

Once in python > plugins, unzip the folder 'globalfate.zip' here. You need to change the line 472 in the file 'globalfate.py' to call the
executable file. Please, change the path accordingly to your device.

Then, go to the QGIS repository and search for "GLOBALFATE".
Finally, install the plugin.
