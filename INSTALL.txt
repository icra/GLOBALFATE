Create executable (tested in Ubuntu and Windows):
1. Open terminal (cygwin or similar in case of Windows) and go to "src" directory
2. run 'make'
3. run 'make clean'
4. create the 'data' and 'results' folders in the folder where you will call the executable. Place input files in the 'data' folder
3. execute ./GLOBALFATE.run
